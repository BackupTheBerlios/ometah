Ometahlab is a set of python scripts to study ometah results, and is
part of the project Open Metaheuristic.

Results are plotted with R (http://www.r-project.org).

You must have compiled ometah previously. For that you'll need scons
tool (http://www.scons.org) if you get ometah from source, obviously 
you don't need it if you have the binary files already compiled.

Rpy (http://rpy.sf.net) is needed to plot results, and obviously you
need R to (http://www.r-project.org), which must be correctly
configured, the executable file must be in your $PATH variable.

If you have Psyco installed (http://psyco.sf.net), it is used by the
script, but otherwise you won't get an error.


DOC
----------------------------/

Ometahlab use is pretty easy, only take a look at demos in demo.py
source code, or the following example.

See : 

    Examples in demo.py

    >>> help(ometahtest)

    >>> help(ometahstats)

Short example :

      >>> import ometahtest
      >>> import ometahstats

      To create a test (a set of runs):
      >>> test = ometahtest.Test()

      Set the arguments (see ometah --usage):
      >>> test.setArgs('-e 100 -p Rosenbrock -P 0.01')

      Set the number of runs (default: 25):
      >>> test.setNbRuns(40)

      Set the path to ometah (below is the default value):
      >>> test.setOmetahPath('../ometah/ometah')

      Start the test:
      >>> test.start()

      The stat() function takes a list of paths as an argument, you
      can specify as much paths as you want:
      >>> ometahstats.stat( [test.getPath()] )
