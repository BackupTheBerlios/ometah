Ometahtest is a set of python scripts to study ometah results.
Results are plotted with R (http://www.r-project.org).

You must have compiled ometah previously.

Rpy (http://rpy.sf.net) is needed to plot results, and obviously you
need R to (http://www.r-project.org).

If you have Psyco installed (http://psyco.sf.net), it is used by the
script, but otherwise you won't get an error.

Some examples 
----------------------------/

#!/usr/bin/python

try:
    import psyco
    psyco.full()
except:
    pass

# you need to import those 2 modules
import ometah_test
import ometah_stats

# instance a new test, that is a set of multiple runs 
# of the same command line
t = ometah_test.Test()

# give ometah options as a string
# for options list, see 'ometah --help'
t.setArgs('-e 100')

# set the number of times you will run the given command line
t.setNbRuns(20)

# start the test, a directory is created containing XML output,
# and a log of the test.
t.start()

# same thing for another test, with a different command line
u = ometah_test.Test()
u.setArgs('-e 200')
u.setNbRuns(20)
u.start()

# you'll need to build a list of the path where are stocked the ouputs
# if you have already done some tests, you can specify the directory
# explicitely
# ie : p = ['aPath', 'anotherPath' ]
# there is no limitation on the list size
p = [ t.getPath(), u.getPath() ]

# launch the comparison between the given tests,
ometah_stats.compare(p)
