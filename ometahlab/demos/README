To launch the demos, use python.

For example, in a shell, type :
    python demo_simple.py

The scripts assumes that the oMetah binary is in a directory named "ometah", at the same level that the "ometahlab" one. Thus your paths should be like :
|
|- ometah
|  \- ometah (the executable binary)
\- ometahlab
   \-demo
     \- demo_simple.py (or one of the demo script)
