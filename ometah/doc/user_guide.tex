\section{Open Metaheuristic modules}

The Open metaheuristics library is separated in several modules:

\begin{description}
\item [ometah:]the core of the library and the main command line interface,
\item [ometahlab:]a set of scripts for algorithms tests and graphical outputs,
\item [registration:]a example of application (rigid registration of images).
\end{description}

\section{Main user interface}

The current command line options can be listed by typing:

\begin{lyxcode}
ometah~-{}-help
\end{lyxcode}

\subsubsection{Adaptive Learning Search}

In oMetah, metaheuristics are considered as adaptive learning searches
(ALS). The basic steps of such iterative algorithms are shown on the
algorithm~\ref{alg:ALS_base}.

%
\begin{algorithm}

\caption{\label{alg:ALS_base}Adaptive Learning Search basic algorithm.}

\begin{description}
\item [Initialize]a sample (a set of points);
\item [Iterate]until stopping criteria:

\begin{description}
\item [Using]a sample of the objective function;
\item [Learning:]the algorithm extracts {}``interesting'' informations
from the sample;
\item [Diversification:]it searches for new solutions;
\item [Intensification:]it searches to improve the existing sample;
\item [Replace]the previous sample with the new one.
\end{description}
\item [End]~
\end{description}

\end{algorithm}



\subsubsection{Components}

The framework is composed of three main component: \emph{metaheuristics},
\emph{problems} and \emph{communication}. In order to facilitate an
easy connection with third party softwares, metaheuristics and problems
are separated. Metaheuristics are asking problems the value(s) of
a point through a communication interface. The communication component
follows a client/server design, permiting to use several communication
protocols.

metaheuristics and problems in \emph{oMetah}.}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Classes}

The structure of the framework follows two design patterns: the \emph{template}
and the \emph{abstract factory}. The abstract factory is only used
in the main interface, to facilitate the manipulation of several instances
of different classes into a single container. The template pattern
is used in the three main component of the framework.


\paragraph{Creating classes with the template}

The Template Method is a quite simple behavioral pattern, it only
consists in defining the skeleton of an algorithm, while allowing
subclasses to define particular steps of the algorithm. It can be
used for the metaheuristics classes (see figure \ref{cap:UML-template}),
which need to share basic attributes or methods (sample, output, etc.)
but will implement differently common methods (diversification, intensification
and learning) that will be called by the main procedure. The same
structure is used for both problems and communication interfaces.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[%
  scale=0.4]{als_template.pdf}\end{center}


\caption{\label{cap:UML-template}UML diagram of the template pattern, used
to implement a metaheuristic as an \emph{ALS}.}
\end{figure}



\paragraph{Manipulating instances with the abstract factory and the Set}

Abstract Factory belongs to the class of creation design patterns.
It provides an easy way to create objects sharing common properties
but one won't have to explicitly specify which classes. In a simple
way, one will define one abstract factory, as an instance of an abstract
class, that will be used to create instances of derived classes, via
their own factories.

For example, an abstract factory would allow to create instances of
specific metaheuristics, so as to, for example, add them to a specific
set, by using the same interface for all. One only has to define a
subclass of the metaheuristic factory for each metaheuristic that
we program (see figure \ref{cap:UML-abstract-factory}). As a result,
one has not to specify the type of objects wanted, it even remains
unknown.

pattern, used to manipulate metaheuristics implementations.}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}\includegraphics[%
  scale=0.4]{ometah_set.pdf}\end{center}


\caption{\label{cap:UML-set-class}UML diagram of the set class.}
\end{figure}


In order to handle the different object types, we use an abstraction
of a set of objects (see figure~\ref{cap:UML-set-class}). Thanks
to this class and to the abstract factory pattern, it is possible
to manipulate several objects sharing a common interface.This class
can be used to connect several metaheuristics with several problems
through several communication protocols.
