\title{Open Metaheuristic : coding guidelines}

\maketitle

\section{Coding style}


\subsection{Header comment blocks}

All files should include the LGPL statement as the header :

\begin{quotation}
\texttt{Open Metaheuristic is a library aimed at the conception of
metaheuristics for difficult optimization.}

\end{quotation}
Add the list of the authors.


\subsection{Comments}

Code must be highly commented. 

If applicable, one should use the doxygen syntax, see Doxygen web site \url{http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/}.


\subsection{Control structures}

Use a space between the controle statement and the opening parenthesis.

Use brackets, even if they are optional.


\subsection{Functions}

No spaces between the function name, the opening parenthesis, and
the first parameter. 

Spaces between commas and each parameter. 

No space between the last parameter, the closing parenthesis, and
the semicolon.

Put the first opening brackets after a function delcaration on a new
line.


\subsection{Naming}

If there is a logical hierarchy, name should reflect it, from the
most general word, to the most precise one. Use the underscore as
the first depth of hierarchy, and {}``studly caps'' notation as
the second depth.\\
the extension of the Source files is ``.cpp'', and the header files is ``.h''


\subsubsection{Classes}

Class names should always begin with {}``its'' followed by an uppercase
letter. Use descriptive names, abbreviations should be employed only
for algorithms name (e.g. NMS, GA, ACO, SA, etc.).

Examples : itsMetaheuristic, itsCGA\_SubClass


\subsubsection{Functions}

The initial letter of the name is lowercase, capitalize each letter
that starts a new word. 

Example : get\_pointNumber


\subsubsection{Variables}

The initial letter of the name is lowercase, capitalize each letter
that starts a new word. 

Examples : sample\_initial\_pointNumber, iteration\_maxNumber


\subsection{Formatting}

Use ISO-8859-1 character encoding.

Lines must end only with a line feed.

Use an indent of 4 spaces, no tabs.

It is recommended to break lines approximatively at 80 characters,
if possible.
